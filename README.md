## Project Description

The AI Drawing Torture Chamber is a web-based drawing game where an AI mercilessly judges your artistic skills while actively sabotaging your work. It's designed to test both your drawing ability and your patience as the AI constantly changes rules, erases your work, and provides sarcastic feedback.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In a world where digital art tools are too helpful and supportive, artists have become soft. They expect undo buttons, smooth brushes, and encouraging feedback. Whatever happened to the good old days when creating art was a struggle against cruel, uncaring forces 

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We've created the ultimate artistic gauntlet - a drawing game where the AI actively works against you. It changes the rules mid-drawing, erases your work "for improvements," gives you impossible challenges, and provides the most backhanded compliments imaginable. Consider it artistic boot camp.
